	<h4>LGS Legal Database</h4>
	<p>This is the most important content of LGS Online. LGS Legal Database consists of LGS database compiled for more than 25 years of corporate law practices in Indonesia of the firm pioneered and led by the three founders, Timbul Thomas Lubis, Mohamed Idwan Ganie and Arief T. Surowidjojo.</p>

	<h4>Laws and Regulations</h4>
	<p>The LGS Legal Database comprises of about 6,000 Indonesian laws and regulations, which will be updated timely. LGS has access to reliable sources of Indonesian laws and regulations at all levels. The sources include the State Printing Company, State Secretary, parliaments, technical departments issuing the laws and regulations, and other sources. The searching mechanism is very much user-friendly and it finds references to the origin of the laws and regulations, history of amendments, and related laws and regulations. The searching could be done by simply using key word, type of law or regublation, year of issuance, or name of the law or regulation.</p> 
	<p>Finding prevailing laws and regulations in Indonesia is not an easy task. There is no public service allowing public to access a complete compilation of laws and regulations. Lawyers normally do it for clients by spending lots of hours, looking into the State Gazette or issuing department or agency, unnecessary efforts that cost clients expensive hours of their lawyers. There is no such a complete compilation of laws and regulations compared to the one established and managed by hukumonline.com, the main source of laws and regulations of LGS Legal database. LGS Online in cooperation with hukumonline.com make it possible for LGS Online users to obtain such enormous valuable data almost without any efforts.</p>

	<h4>LGS Legal Memoranda</h4>
	<p>Another important content of this feature is the LGS Legal Memoranda. This content represents the works of LGS for more than the last 25 years, revisited and revised pursuant to the prevailing laws, regulations and government policy, and generally accepted corporate and financial best practices. The coverage of issues includes the most important issues in the fields of corporate law, investment law, corporate finance (including capital markets), labor and commercial litigation. Efforts are being made to add it up to include other fields of laws and law practices, including antitrust, project finance, secured transaction, energy, oil and gas, mining, infra structure, privatization, agriculture, forestry, international trade, maritime, shipping, aviation, bank restructuring, debt restructuring, insurance, Syariah (Islamic) finance, and many others.</p>
	<p>By the time the LGS Legal Memoranda is uploaded with those legal memoranda, practically most frequent questions from businesses will be answered online. Specific questions may still be asked for specific transactions. This will be answered by experienced lawyers of LGS using the feature “Discussion with LGS Partners” on LGS Online that will be launched shortly to answer questions from clients directed to the LGS Partner(s), almost real time, and if technology permits, it may be shortcut with a “chatting feature” with the LGS partners answering questions from clients in real time fashion.</p>

	<h4>LGS Forms and Agreements</h4>
	<p>Standard forms and agreements are basically results of intellectual works based on in depth research, that absorb also practical knowledge accepted generally by best corporate practices, and most of the time resulted from tough negotiation. Many of them have been tested through dispute settlement porcess in and outside the court rooms. Doing business in Indonesia has been so far considered quite unique. Moreover, practice of law in Indonesia has been considered significantly incomparable with those practiced in not only developed countries with developed legal systems and traditions, but also some neighboring countries. Politics, social conditions, economic development and cultural aspects dictate where the laws should go. Consistency is not a word to hold, and effective enforcement does always affect the way business consideration is made.</p>
	<p>The standard forms and agreements as designed in many thick books issued by world-class law practice gurus may not be workable effectively for doing business in Indonesia. Each transaction in Indonesia shall be tailor-made, consider the interests tha should be protected, follow local business trend, and also represent the latest government policy, accepted practices, and judiciary view that may be have been established on the subject. The LGS forms and agreements adopt such principles, and are Indonesian specific. The forms and agreements could be accessed easily, but may need tailored refinements suitable to represent the interests of the users, and that could be discussed in no time with the LGS lawyers. This could cut-off all red tapes, time, and costs substantially. We talk about a joint venture agreement we provide that would cost you US$ 100.00, compared to obtaining it from a Jakarta-based law firm that could easily cost a client thousands of US$.</p>
	<p>The standard forms and agreements are meant to be used with a strict guidance from Indonesian lawyers or law professionals or in-house counsels. In case of doubt, the users shall consult with LGS lawyers for more detailed explanation.</p>

	<h4>Boilerplate Provisions</h4>
	<p>This feature gives practicing lawyers or in-house counsels a quick reference to provisions that generally used in most contracts. This enables the users to concentrate in the core provisions of the contract, and forget about spending time to draft general provisions of the contract. This consists of provisions relating to parties, conditions precedents, anti competition, confidentiality, positive and negative covenants, termination, consequences of termination, governing law and jurisdiction, mediation, arbitration and other dispute resolution clauses. Drafting a contract will never be so easy and practical, as most of the provisions are matters of “copy, paste, and execute”.</p>

	<h4>Litigation Reports</h4>
	<p>This feature reports decisions of Indonesian courts on important business issues that may affect investment or commercial considerations of the businesses. Not all court decisions are reported and accessed by public. The Indonesian Supreme Court reports what they think important cases. Association of judges also publishes court decisions in their own magazine. However, there is no assurance that a case on important business issues is reported therein. LGS Online will make best efforts in proactively posting such important decisions in this feature.</p>
